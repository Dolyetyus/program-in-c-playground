This is my custom stack implementation which I will use later in some projects probably.

The stack has an initial size of 8 integers. However, if more elements are added, the stack size dynamically expands as needed. So, stack overflow is impossible unless the computer runs out of resources.

__Operations:__
* Push: Pushes an element unto the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Pop: Pops and returns the top element from the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Peek: Returns the top element from the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Total: Returns the sum of all values in the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Is Empty?: Returns if stack is empty or not. Time complexity: O(1)
* Display: Displays the stack. Time complexity: O(n)
* Exit: Ends the main loop and exits the program.
