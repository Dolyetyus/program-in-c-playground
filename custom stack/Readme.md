This is my custom stack implementation which I will use later in some projects probably.

__Operations:__
* Push: Pushes an element unto the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Pop: Pops and returns the top element from the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Peek: Returns the top element from the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Total: Returns the sum of all values in the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
* Is Empty?: Returns if stack is empty or not. Time complexity: O(1)
* Display: Displays the stack. Time complexity: O(n)
* Exit: Ends the main loop and exits the program.
